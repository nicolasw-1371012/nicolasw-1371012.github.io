					<h1>Who are they?</h1>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Migos are a hip hop group consisting of three members: Quavo, Takeoff and Offset. They were formed in 2009 and have since released two albums, <i>Yung Rich Nation</i> and <i>Culture</i>. 
					They're considered one of the hottest, if not the hottest, hip-hop group in the industry. They've collaborated with other famed hip-hop rappers, such as Gucci Mane, Travis Scott, Drake and more, and producers, like Zaytoven and Murda Beatz.
					Their first claim to fame was their high-charting single "Versace" which later got remixed by Drake. 
					But perhaps their most famous song to date is "Bad and Boujee" which features vocals from fellow Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane.</h3>

					<h1>The Members</h1>
					<h2>Quavo</h2>

					<h3>He's known for his melodic use of autotune and is perhaps the most well-known of the members due to his prolific features found in other songs in the past year. 
						He's been featured in Travis Scott and Young Thug's "Pick Up the Phone", DJ Khaled's "I'm the One", Post Malone's "Congratulations" and more.</h3>
					<h2>Takeoff</h2>
					<img src="http://ime.ulximg.com/image/740x493/gallery/1425414009_551655158830bd75a4b4aaa46ccaf3af.png/d762f7a8eafc5f40b94077908f4922fb/1425414009_screen_shot_2015_03_03_at_1_14_37_pm_99.png"style="width:500px;height:500x">
					<h3>Unfortunately, Takeoff is thought to be the lingering afterthought of the group because of his absence on songs in which Migos feature in, as well as their most popular song "Bad and Boujee".
						However, the reality is Takeoff just doesn't like to do features. He's definitely a valued part of the group.</h3>
					<h2>Offset</h2>
					<img src="https://hypebeast.imgix.net/http%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2017%2F04%2Fmigos-offset-xxxtentacion-drake-beef.jpg?fit=max&fm=pjpg&ixlib=php-1.1.0&q=90&w=1024&s=84752007b89dc95d667858ceaadf935d"style="width:500px;height:500x">
					<h3>Offset is considered as the most talented rapper of the group. His advanced and speedy flow is showcased prominently on Calvin Harris' song "Slide" as well as on a majority of their songs.
						Offset is probably the second most prolific of the Migos members, as he's starting to show up on a lot of other artists' songs, such as Gucci Mane's "Met Gala".</h3>
